# The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook

This is my repo with the implementation of examples from "The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook".

I'm learning elixir ([more on that here](http://willcodeforskipass.com/blog/im-gonna-learn-elixir-again/)) and I'm following this book to grasp fundamentals.
Originally I didn't plan on doing this repository, however, I found that the biggest example in the book (the worker pool application from chapter 6 and 7) is... not working as intended if you follow the book.

Note: I'm using the "The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook - corrected 9182019" version. (ISBN 9781633430112)
